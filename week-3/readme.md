# Filtering as templates

## 1D cross-correlation 
if we take a 1D signal and apply a correlation filter made from a part of the same signal, the resulting waveform will have its highest peak at the region from where the filter was taken.

## 2D cross-correlation
It is same as 1D cross-correlation except now we deal two images and 2D filters.

## Template Matching
