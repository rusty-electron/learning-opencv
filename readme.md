# Learning OpenCV
This repository contains my week-wise journey of learning computer vision by using OpenCV C++ Library as the primary tool. One can take up this series of code implementation as the path to learning OpenCV. I have listed study materials that go hand in hand with this content so that one can lookup the theory behind the algorithms and explore alternate code implementations of the same.

## Getting Started:

I have written these programs in my Windows machine and used Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition as Compiler + IDE Setup. For Linux OS, I would recommend checking out OpenCV Linux documentation. 

For Windows, Visual Studio CE is the easiest method to begin compiling OpenCV Code. I tried to compile OpenCV 3.x.x source using MinGW using CMake for running in Codeblocks but wasn't successful.

## Prerequisites

* Programming Knowledge
    * Writing and reading C++ code 
    * Using any IDE for C++
* Softwares
    * [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) (I used 2017)
    * [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/releases.html) (3.4.2 at my time)
* Willingness to learn Computer Vison (*Duh!*)

## Installation

For Visual Studio CE Installation, you can follow this [video](https://youtu.be/7EHJafw3djk).

<hr>

For OpenCV Installation and setup, you can follow this [video](https://youtu.be/M-VHaLHC4XI)

> Although this video installs an older version of OpenCV, the setup procedure is still the same.

## Running the code

Visual Studio users can simply open the `.sln` file provided in each folder to load the projects with the required configurations.

The `Source.cpp` file can be found at the sub-directory of the same name.

The compiled `executables` can be found in the `x64/debug` folder.
